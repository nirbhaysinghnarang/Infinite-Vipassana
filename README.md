To run, you need an `elevenlabs` API key 
and (optional but strongly recommended) an `elevenlabs` voice ID 
to override the default voice.

If you want, you may use the .mp3 data in this repository (use the files in `/data/audio/chunked/by_5` to get files which fit within the 10MB upload limit)
to clone GD Goenka's voice.

Along with your OpenAI key, please place these env variables in a `.env` file before attempting to run the script `run.py`

As always, please activate a `venv` and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` before doing anything!
