got his seat, menu is placed before him, he goes through that menu, wonderful. The food prepared today is very delicious, his mouth starts watering, wonderful, one incident. Now he orders for the food, it will take some time before it is served and he looks around people who had come earlier, they are already served food and they are taking their food and they are enjoying it, certainly the food is very delicious today. Look everybody is enjoying, again the mouth starts watering, second incident, third incident the food is served to this person and he starts enjoying it. The first was Swatmaya Panya, that menu card only he had read, he had not tasted it. The second Chintamaya Panya, his intellect sees because he has seen people when they enjoy something, their facial expressions are of this type and look these people are enjoying because their facial expressions say that they are enjoying it, certainly it must be very delicious. He has not tasted it himself, only the third time when it was given to him, he started eating it, tasting it, then yes, he started really enjoying it, this is Bhavanamaya Panya. The first and the second cannot make you taste the reality, another example, someone is sick, goes to a doctor, doctor examines and then writes medicine, a prescription on a paper, very happy comes back home, has great faith in the doctor, nothing wrong, one must have faith in one's doctor, physician. But how this one, this faith becomes blind faith, devotion becomes blind devotion, in his house on the altar he places a statue of the doctor, picture of the doctor and offers sweet and fruits and flowers and incense and then makes 108 rounds around it and bows down three times, what does that help, takes out that piece of paper and keeps on reciting, one pill in the morning, one pill in the afternoon, one pill in the evening, one pill in the morning, one pill in the afternoon, what does one get, madness, this is what happens when the faith becomes blind faith, the devotion becomes blind devotion. After all, a human being, a rational being, so he runs to the doctor, why you gave me this piece of paper and what is this, how will it help me? The doctor is an intelligent fellow, he says, well look, this is your disease and this is the cause of the disease, if you take this medicine, this cause will get eradicated, when the cause gets eradicated, your sickness gets eradicated, ah, wonderful, now I understand, my doctor is so wonderful, his medicine is so wonderful and what he does now? Coming back home, he starts fighting with all the neighbours, useless, your doctors are all useless, my doctor is wonderful, the medicine suggested by your doctors is useless, the medicine suggested by my doctor is wonderful, keeps on fighting, doesn't take medicine, keeps on fighting, oh, this is what happens, every wise person, a saintly person, an enlightened person, when he finds people miserable, suffering, then he gives this prescription of Dhamma, you practice Sheela, you practice Samadhi, you practice Punya, you will come out of your misery, nobody tries to practice, they start different sects, beliefs, dogmas, rites, rituals and get involved in that and nobody practices, no benefit and the third Punya, Bhavanamaya Punya is to apply Dhamma in life by direct experience, it is only this which gives the benefit, your own direct experience. Now, the difficulty comes, how to have direct experience, direct experience of this mind matter phenomena, how a constant interaction is going on and because of that, how the negativity gets originated and then starts multiplying, starts overpowering you and how with the understanding of that, you can stop the arising of this negativity, even if it has arisen, you won't allow it to multiply and overpower you, all that has to be experienced and that is, all that is happening at the depth of the mind. You must develop a faculty, an ability, capability to experience it, these three days, this is what you were doing, unless you have that capability, that faculty, you can't practice Vipassana, not possible, like if you don't have your eye faculty, you can't see anything, if you don't have your ear sense faculty, you can't hear anything, similarly this mind faculty which takes you to the depth of the mind and matter interaction, unless you have this faculty, you can't. An example, two friends, young boys, very poor, live the life of beggar, they go around and beg food, one of them is blind, birth blind, one day it so happened that this friend who was blind, birth blind, he had very high fever, so the other friend said, all right, you stay here, I will go around and beg food and then we shall eat together, he went and it so happened that day, a housewife felt very compassionate and she offered a very sweet dish, in our country we call it kheer, a pudding prepared from milk and rice and dry fruits and sweet etcetera, this was offered, he was very happy, he enjoyed it, but this is liquid and he has no container to take for his friend, so he could not, could not bring to the friend, came back and very honestly told him, today in the begging I got this kheer, so delicious, but sorry I could not bring for you, I had no container, all right, you didn't bring, you didn't bring, but tell me what is this kheer, you don't know what is kheer, I don't know what is kheer, oh it is white, because made of milk, so white, white, what is white, you don't know what is white, I don't know what is white, it is not black, but what is black, you don't know white, you don't know black, what sort of person you are, I don't know, I don't know what is white, what is black, birth blind, how can I know what is white, what is black, he was looking here and there and he saw one white duck, got hold of it and brought, look, white like this duck, white like this duck, he has no eyes, how can he see what is white and what is this duck, he uses his finger tips, passes his hand over this duck, ah, now I understand what is white, white is very soft, very soft, what soft, what softness has got to do with white, you said it is like this duck and I touched it, it is so soft, now you say white is not soft, how can I understand what is white, oh you mad fellow, I told you white is like this duck and you can't understand it, all right, let me examine again and he examines again, from the beak he starts up to the end of the plume, the whole body, ah, now I understand it is crooked, white is crooked, so for all those people who talk of high philosophies, high philosophies, but have never experienced anything because they don't have the faculty to experience it, for them the truth is always crooked, the whole life the truth will remain crooked, crooked, crooked, they can't understand, this faculty to experience the truth is very important and this is what you started doing, if you are just working with your shila and don't take the next step of samadhi, you would not have got this faculty, you started with samadhi and if you had worked with the samadhi with some object of imagination, verbalization, visualization, again you would not have got this faculty because you worked with the reality, reality pertaining to your own mind matter phenomena and you started working on this area with the breath which is truth and you are experiencing it, then the touch of the breath, you are experiencing it and now the third day you started feeling sensations, the biochemical reactions here, this is how you are going to the deeper levels of your own mind, the deepest level of the mind, what is called the unconscious, mind is actually not unconscious, this is all the time conscious day and night but conscious of the sensations on the body that you started experiencing here, such sensations are there throughout the body, throughout the body something or the other is happening, something or the other is happening, some change is taking place, a change with the manifestation of this sensation or a change with the manifestation of that sensation or some change is going on and that can be experienced only by whatever you did for these three days, a beginning is made, tomorrow you will explore the entire field and you will find everywhere some sensation or the other, this is how you are moving from the surface level of your mind to the depth of the mind, where deep rooted complexes from the past are all accumulated there, where lies the behavior pattern of your mind, the deepest level of your mind and the behavior pattern of this mind is to react, whenever it feels any pleasant sensation on the body, it reacts with craving, with clinging, whenever it experiences any unpleasant sensation on the body, it reacts with aversion, with hatred, you are moving towards that, moving towards that. At the intellectual level, it is very easy, it is very easy to understand that there is a change taking place everywhere and everything is so impermanent, anyone who takes birth dies, anything that is manufactured later or sooner or later gets destroyed, everything is impermanent, but that is an intellectual understanding, experience of it can be only within the framework of your body, the law of nature is law of nature everywhere, inside, outside, but the law of nature that you see outside can be acceptable, can be understood at the intellectual level, but the reality, the law that you experience within the framework of the body can be experienced and this experience is called Bhavanamaya Pannya, you are living there, you have direct experience, otherwise it does not help, at the intellectual level, there were teachers before Buddha, at the time of Buddha, after Buddha, who kept on giving the same teaching, but it didn't work to the depth as it worked for people who started developing their own Bhavanamaya Pannya, like something very traumatic happens in the life, a very near or dear one has passed away and you take his dead body to the funeral pyre and burn it or to the graveyard and put it in the grave, while that is going on, one develops so much of wisdom, after all, everything is so impermanent, one who takes birth dies, nobody is free from death, I will also die one day, people will bring my body, put in this grave or burn on this funeral pyre, then what is the use of all this craving, clinging, fighting with people, accumulating this or that, ultimately everything will be left here and my body will be burned, big wisdom, but how long, as soon as one takes one step out of that graveyard, again the same, I, I, mine, mine, all madness is there, makes no difference, it was only intellectual understanding or people come to such dhamma talks, such discourses, ah, wonderful, now I understand, why this attachment is so bad, it gives so much of misery, the more you are attached, the more miserable you are bound to be, misery, misery, this I is a big misery, mine is a big misery, big misery, at the end of the discourse, you go out of the hall, hey, where are my shoes, who has taken away, my slippers I purchased only today, new ones, what happened, start crying, crying, mine, mine, mine, makes no difference, it is all intellectual, doesn't help, one has to experience, and it is so difficult to experience, so easy to understand at the intellectual level, so easy to accept it at the devotional level, so difficult to experience, because unless you have that faculty of experience, you can't, there is so much of illusion, so much of delusion, at the apparent level, something appears to be so, seems to be so, actual level is totally different, like night time, you go to bed, you lit a lamp or a candle, you go to sleep, next morning you get up, and you see the candle, the light of the candle, the light of the lamp, and you are under the impression, the same candle, the same light, where the same candle, where the same light, every moment, if flame arises and passes away, another takes its place and passes away, another takes its place and passes away, there is no interval, continuously, and that gives an impression, the same flame, the same light, the same flame, the same light, a big illusion, this electric bulb, I pointed towards it twice, one remains under the impression, the same light, the same light, where the same light, if it was the same light, then why at the end of the month, this electric company sends me a bill, you consume so many minutes, so many dollars, what for? My light I purchased in the market, my switch, on it, I get my light, who are you, what for you want money? He is quite correct, he is generating there, electricity, it comes through the wires, gets consumed, new takes its place with such great rapidity, the old one passes away, the new takes its place, the old one passes away with such great rapidity, it gives the impression, the same, the same. Another example, you cross the river, morning you cross the river, went to the other bank of the river, whole day you worked there and then again, you took the boat and came on this side of the river, you are under the impression, I have crossed the same river, where the same river, even if you take a dip in this river, you take a dip and the head above the water, second dip, head above the water, third dip, head above the water, you are under impression that I am taking dip in the same river, where same river, constant flow is there, the dip that you had in the river is gone, not a single drop remains, all have gone, second dip in a second river altogether, third dip in a third river altogether, the morning you cross this river by your boat, by evening it was a totally new river and yet the impression remains the same, the same river, the same light. How to come out of this? Certain things which are within the capacity of your sense organs, you have got eyes and you can see things, there is a limitation for that. The flame of the lamp arising, passing, arising, passing, if you see very carefully, you can notice arising, passing, arising, passing, but the light of electricity, it arises and passes with such a great rapidity beyond your eyes capacity. The flow of the river, yes it is flowing, the second dip is a new river, third dip is a new river, if you give attention you can understand, but how to understand? This fellow who took the first dip is gone, second dip is taken by altogether a new person, third dip is taken by altogether a new person, how to understand that? You don't have that faculty to experience it. If one has not practiced Vipassana, then this Goenka, who started talking about half an hour ago, will remain under the impression, the same Goenka, I am the same Goenka, the same Goenka was yesterday, the same Goenka was one year ago or ten years ago, fifty years ago, sixty years ago, sixty-seven years ago, same Goenka, the same Goenka, every moment this Goenka is dying, another Goenka is taking birth, every moment this Goenka is dying, another Goenka is taking birth, the entire physical structure made of this subatomic particles, arising, passing, arising, passing, with such great rapidity, such great rapidity, such speed creates illusion, delusion, confusion, one cannot understand the reality, even if one accepts the reality at the intellectual level, because the scientists have said so, the entire material world, there is no solidity, it is only wavelets, wavelets, wavelets, the modern scientist says so, while an enlightened person like a Buddha has said so, there is no solidity anywhere, just wavelets, entire universe, mind and matter, nothing but wavelets, vibration, vibration, because you have got faith in them and you accept, that doesn't help, you have to experience yourself, and this is what was done by him to reach the final goal of full liberation, and that is what everyone has to do, to understand the change taking place, every moment changing, changing, changing, with great rapidity changing, a child is born, you see the child, beautiful, tender, you see the child after 10 years, big changes come, and you see with the interval of 20 years, big change, 30, 40, 60, 80 years, unbelievable, the same child, how he became like this, and how he became like this, not that at the end of every 10 years, he went to bed and some god almighty passed a magic wand over his body and he changed the person, nothing doing, every moment change is taking place, every moment changing, changing, changing, decaying, decaying, growing, decaying, growing, decaying, this is the law of nature, this law of nature if one accepts at the intellectual level or at the devotional level, does not help at all, it is just an intellectual pleasure, intellectual entertainment, or a devotional pleasure, a devotional entertainment, it won't help, but at the actual level when one starts experiencing it, it makes such a big difference, and this is what he did, what you have started doing is just a very tiny step, it is a long path, one has to investigate so much deep inside to understand what this material structure is, what this mind is, and what interaction is going on at a very deep level, and this made him fully enlightened, dividing, dissecting, disintegrating, dissolving, dissolving, he reached the stage where he came to the ultimate truth pertaining to the matter, the ultimate truth pertaining to the mind, the ultimate truth pertaining to the mental contents, the mental concomitants which arise with the mind, and then he transcended that and experienced something which is beyond mind and matter, for the matter, dividing, dissecting, dividing, dissecting, he came to the tiniest subatomic particle of his, the entire body is made, the tiniest to which he gave a name Kalapa, Kalapa means a unit, a material unit, tiniest material unit which cannot be further separated, he called it Athakalapa, Atha means eight, eight things joined together make this unit, and these eight things cannot be separated, they are always together.
