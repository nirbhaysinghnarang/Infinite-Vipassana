But not this, because you don't have any other disease. Which disease is a pleasure? Every disease is a suffering, misery, misery, vyadhi pidukha, vyadhi pidukha, and one keeps in contact, coming in contact, this disease or that disease, this disease or that disease. One keeps on growing, growing, decaying, decaying, becoming old, old. The old age is a great misery, jara pidukha, jara pidukha, a great misery. A hundred year old man, hundred year old woman, suffering from this disease or that disease, this weakness, that weakness, the old age, so many problems. And then prays to God Almighty, Oh God Almighty, please send death, so that I am relieved of all this misery. You don't have scarcity of death, please give me death, prays, prays, and next the doctor comes and examines, old lady, now your time has come, maybe by tomorrow you have to quit. Old man, by tomorrow you might have to quit. And the old lady, and the old man, Oh no, no doctor, I made a wrong prayer, I don't want to die, I don't want to die, I have to meet my son, my grandson, my great great great grandson, I have to do this, I have to do that, please save me somehow, I don't want to die. Death is a great misery, great misery, maranam pedukkam, maranam pedukkam. What else? This man, he was not playing intellectual game, sitting under the tree, he was experiencing the truth inside, why? What is the cause of misery? Going deeper, deeper, deeper, a reality came, Oh, whatever we desire, that desire is not fulfilled, one becomes miserable. Sitting, you have a desire that the pain should go away, and the pain does not go, you become so miserable. Sitting, and you want a lot of sensation of bliss, ecstasy, but it's not coming, and you are miserable. Oh, whatever you desire, you are not getting it, you become miserable. Wanted person, unwanted situation, unwanted things, you get associated with them, associated with them. Wanted things, wanted person, wanted situation, you get disassociated, disassociated, big misery, big misery. He was understanding all that deep inside, and then going deeper, deeper, deeper, he came to the stage where it became so clear, Sankhyatena Pancha Upadana Khanda Dukha. At the depth, in short, the misery is these five aggregates. One aggregate is the material aggregate, the subatomic particles, the entire body made of subatomic particles, kalapas, and four other aggregates, mental aggregates, cognizing part of the mind, recognizing part of the mind, feeling part of the mind, and reacting part of the mind, these five together has made this personality, I, and tremendous amount of attachment towards it, Upadana, Upadana is attachment, clinging. All these five aggregates are result of the clinging, clinging, and one keeps on clinging to these five aggregates, and like this one keeps on rolling in misery, rolling in misery, it was becoming clearer and clearer, this Upadana, clinging, attachment. There are four basic attachments. One attachment is towards this I, an imaginary I, without knowing what is this I, an imaginary I, the subatomic particles, the mass of the subatomic particle is this I, and yet one keeps on saying this as I, I, those four aggregates, the cognizing part of the mind cognizes and passes away, it cognizes, passes away, is this I? Recognizing part of the mind recognizes and passes away, is this I? The feeling part of the mind feels and passes away, is this I? The reacting part of the mind reacts and passes away, is this I? Therefore the five joined together is I, but I is so important, always a capital I, anyone says one word against this I, one feels so irritated, so agitated, without understanding what is this I, an imaginary I, a created I, and yet so much attachment to this I, someone does one work against this I and again one feels so irritated, so agitated, so unhappy, I, I, I, tremendous amount of attachment towards this I, brings nothing but misery, nothing but misery. Then this fear, this circle of I starts spreading, what you call mind, mind comes in this circle and then you have attachment towards this mind, mind, mind, and tremendous amount of attachment towards this mind, mind, mind, oh this my watch, wonderful watch, such a valuable watch, one of the student brought from the foreign countries and offered me wonderful watch, such a valuable watch, out of my carelessness one day it falls down and breaks, and I start crying, oh this valuable watch, got broken now, and I don't get even spare parts in my country, how to get it repaired, crying, crying, crying, a watch of the same model, of the same value, on the wrist of my friend, and it falls down, and it breaks, I don't cry, I don't cry at all, on the other hand I start giving sermons, my friend you should have been very careful, this type of watch not available in our country, you can't get even spare parts to repair it, I don't cry, why? Same watch of the same model, of the same value, but I don't cry, nobody cries for the breakage of a valuable watch, nobody cries, one cries for the breakage of my watch, my watch is broken, my watch is broken, this mind, mind, and tremendous amount of attachment towards this mind, mind, whether this mind, the so called mind is worth a few dollars or a few million dollars, makes no difference, how much attachment is there, that much misery is bound to come, the deeper the attachment, the deeper the misery, the stronger the attachment, the stronger the misery, this is law of nature, it will become clearer and clearer as you practice more and more, attachment, clinging is bound to bring misery, nothing but misery. One incident, I was new to India in those days, having come to Burma within, it was within two or three years, there were no centers, so those who were eager for the spread of this technique to different people who are miserable, they used to arrange some site somewhere, a mosque, a temple, a church, things like that, maybe school or something, one course was arranged in a remote village, which was a pilgrim center of the Jains, a Jain temple, hardly one or two from that village participated, most of them came from the nearby cities, one very old and very poor lady came to that course, somebody gave her train fare and she came, participated, two days, three days, four days, five days, very happy, she was progressing and suddenly on the fifth day or the sixth day, she came to know that early morning there is some chanting going on in the main hall and there are some words of blessings and good wishes, etc., can I go, can I also participate, nothing is written in the program, the management said, yes, you can go, but you have to meditate, yes, I will meditate and she came, meditated, at the end of the chanting was so happy, so happy, smiling, smiling, smiling, she went to a residence and as she reached the residence, she cried loudly, crying, crying, people went to her, what happened, has some scorpion punctured her or some snake has kissed her, what's wrong with this old lady and she won't reply, keeps on crying, crying, crying, after some time, sobbing, sobbing, she says, I brought a small cloth purse, textile purse with me and in this purse, there were 20 rupees, less than a dollar, today's dollar, 20 rupees, saving of my whole life was there in it, 20 and 60 years ago, when I was married, I got in dowry, a silver trinket, that was also in it and when I started for this course, somebody gave me a dry piece of sweetmeat, that was also in it and every time I meditate, I keep it under my legs, when I sleep, I keep it under my pillow, now I came here and I left it in my room and somebody has taken it away, oh, I am looted, I am looted, all my saving is gone, keeps on crying, people say, 20 rupees cash, hardly 20 rupees worth of your silver trinket, say 40 rupees or 50 rupees, old lady, don't cry, we will get you 50 rupees, you carry on your meditation, your meditation was going so good, she kept on crying, crying, crying, they told you better collect some money and hand over to her, then only the crying will stop, they started collecting, instead of 50, they got 100, very happy, now the old lady will stop crying, they went and offered, she threw away this money, what to do with this money, that silver trinket which I get in my dowry, oh, we have to get that trinket, now it's gone, people kept on searching, not available, by evening, somebody saw a monkey on the tree, with this purse taking out the sweetmeat and eating, people ran after the monkey and got hold of it and gave that silver trinket to her, her crying stopped, craving, whether it is worth 20 rupees worth of article or 20 million, makes no difference, as much as clinging is there, as much attachment is there, that much misery is bound to be there, bound to be there, I, mine, I, mine, whether you use these words or not, doesn't matter, but this I, mine and your attachment to it, full of misery, full of misery, I remember another incident, again in a very remote village of northern India, a very learned monk participated, after 5 or 6 days, he comes to me, going Kaji, between 12 and 1, you give interviews to the students, and just 10 minutes, in those days, students were less, so I used to give 10 minutes to each student, 10 minutes, for these householders, what questions they have got, even 10 minutes is too much for them, I am a monk, recluse, I have got so many questions, please give me half an hour, I say reverend sir, I know you will be talking about philosophies and all that and I am not interested, I can't give you time, oh no, no, go in Kaji, last 5 days or so, I have understood all these philosophical talks are useless, I will talk only about, about the technique, about the technique, why you require half an hour for technique, no, no, please give me half an hour, alright, somehow I managed, come, and he came, 2, 3, 5 minutes he talked about the technique, and suddenly the topic was changed, subject was changed, go in Kaji, from that big city from which he came, go in Kaji, in that big city, you are monastery, my monastery, monasteries are always for the monks, not for the householders, I am a householder, how can I have monastery, go in Kaji, try to understand, you are monastery, reverend sir, I can't have a monastery, I am a householder, and I carry such a colossal proof testimonial that I am a householder, how can I have a monastery, and he keeps on saying go in Kaji, you are monastery, you are monastery, and after that he says, go in Kaji, in your monastery, you are elephant, my elephant, what he is talking, and then suddenly it clicked in my mind, this is India, a wonderful country, a vast country, having so many traditions, there is a tradition, some people have a strong belief that throughout the life, we don't use this dirty word, I and mine, we don't use, whenever I have to say I, I will say you, whenever I have to say mine, I will say your, ah, now I understand, yes reverend sir, my monastery, my elephant, go ahead, what went wrong, look, he is a recluse, renounced everything, he has built a monastery in the midst of the city, without the permission of the council or municipality, and now the order has come, he will smash it, he will break it, and in the midst of the city, elephant is not allowed to be kept there, so order has come to take it out, and from somewhere he learned, that the lord mayor of the municipality of that city, had been to Burma, and had stayed with me as my guest, so go in Kaji, just a few words from you, and your monastery will be saved, your elephant will be saved, he doesn't use the word I, doesn't use the word mine, but tremendous amount of attachment, attachment is bound to bring misery, nothing but misery, misery, deeper the attachment, deeper the misery is bound to be, there would not have been any misery, if I develop attachment to this I, and this I remains eternal all the time, and I develop attachment to the mine, this mine remains eternal, there is no misery, but the trouble is, this I does not remain eternal, mine does not remain eternal, whatever I say, mine, mine, mine, mine, passes away and I am helpless, I can't do anything, or if this remains, the so called I passes away, and I am helpless, a departure, a separation is bound to come, and that brings so much misery, if the attachment is there, if the clinging is there, the misery is so great, more attachment one develops, main is this I, turns into mine, and then my views, my philosophy, my dogma, my belief, my religion, my tradition, tremendous amount of attachment, one does not understand that I am wearing coloured glasses, and I have got attachment towards the colour of the glass, if I wear red coloured glass, for me everything is red, red, red, somebody is wearing green coloured glass, for him everything is green, green, we keep on fighting with each other, I can't convince him that it is all red, he can't convince me that it is all green, we keep on fighting, break each other's head, still we can't come to terms, because the attachment, and the attachment is to the colour, we don't see things as they are, this big attachment brings big misery, then in some cases there is attachment towards rites, rituals, ceremonies, etc., not here I have seen, but back in the East, people are so very much attached to their daily rites, their daily rituals, they come to the course, and they say why you stop these rites, rituals, give me just 15 minutes, I finish my rite, and then come and meditate, and you say no, they become so agitated because of that, later on of course they start realising, but initially because of the attachment the misery is there, these four big attachments make us so miserable, so miserable, and he was there, to go deeper, deeper, why after all this attachment, and it became clearer and clearer, a craving arises, craving for something that you want, you want to possess, you want to retain, and it very soon turns into clinging, attachment, a craving, you want to get rid of something, you don't like it, and tremendous amount of attachment towards this craving, you don't want it, you want to get rid of it, and yet you can't get rid of it, oh, the craving turns into clinging, into attachment, and the misery starts, why this craving? He was not playing intellectual game, he was not reading scriptures, or discussing scriptures, he was experimenting like a scientist what is happening deep inside, a small little desire starts, you start liking it, and how quickly it turns into craving, a small little desire to get rid of something, it turns into aversion, oh, tanaha, in the language of those days craving means tanaha, tanaha pacchaya upadanam, craving turns into clinging, small little desires turn into craving, and craving into clinging, why these small little desires even, what is the cause? It became so clear, because he was experiencing it, vedana pacchaya tanaha, these sensations on the body, when one experiences sensations on the body, and if the sensation is pleasant, you start liking it, which very soon turns into craving, clinging, when the sensation is unpleasant, when you experience unpleasant sensation, very soon it turns into aversion, hatred, you like to get rid of it, the craving is to get rid of it, oh, the sensations, vedana pacchaya tanaha, pacchaya means the cause, the vedana means sensation, sensation is the cause of your craving which turns into clinging, why these sensations, what is the cause? He was experimenting, what's happening, vasya pacchaya vedana, there is a contact, and as soon as there is a contact, there is bound to be a sensation on the body, contact of what, with what? The six sense doors, the eyes, contact of the eyes with some shape, some form, some color, some light, the object of the eyes, as it comes in contact, there is bound to be a sensation, object of the ear sense door, a sound comes in contact with the ear sense door, there is bound to be a sensation, nose sense door, a smell coming in contact, bound to be a sensation, tongue sense door, a taste coming in contact bound to be a sensation, body sorry body sense door, there is a contact of something tangible, bound to be a sensation, and the mind sense door, any thought, any emotion there is bound to be a sensation on the body, oh, contact, why this contact, and it was so simple, so clear, sarayatan pacchaya phassa, phassa means contact, sarayatan means the six sense doors, so long as one is having the six sense doors, the respective objects, the entire world is full of respective objects, there is bound to be one contact or the other, one sense door or the other, the contact is because of the six sense doors that we carry, and their respective objects in the world, why the six sense doors, what is the cause of this, so clear, namarupa pacchaya sarayatanam, nama means the mental structure, rupa means the physical structure, the combination of these two, as soon as this combination started, that means the life flow started, the continuum of this life started, it started with these six sense doors, why this mind and matter life started like this, and it was so clear, vijnana pacchaya namarupa, this flow of consciousness is there all the time, and as soon as one life ends, this flow of consciousness comes in contact, arises somewhere else, it keeps on arising, passing, arising, passing, at the time of death it passes, then again it arises somewhere in another life, another body and starts flowing in the same way, vijnana pacchaya namarupa, why this vijnana, what is the cause of it, and it was so clear, sankhara pacchaya vijnana, this mental volitional actions that you take place, all mental volitional action are responsible for the consciousness of the next moment, this moment I generate a sankhara, this word you will be listening again and again, sankhara, the mental volitional action, when you generate sankhara, next moment consciousness arises, you generate sankhara, next moment consciousness arises, at the time of death, a very deep sankhara, which is like
