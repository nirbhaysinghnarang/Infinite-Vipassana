Others have served me. Now I better serve others. This is the great satisfaction that you have. Another big satisfaction that you will have at the end of the course. You will feel so much of joy. And this is not the ordinary joy. This is a very sublime joy, a sympathetic joy. You notice when people join the course, their faces are full of melancholy, sadness, having this kind of misery, that kind of misery. But on the tenth day, when they leave the course, there is so much of glow on their face. So much of happiness, so much of joy. And you generate sympathetic joy. You also become so happy. This is a very big advantage that you get from it. Besides that, after all, dhamma is not only for your own liberation. Teaching of Buddha is that of course you liberate yourself, at the same time you help others to get liberated. And then the same thing you are doing by giving dhamma service, you are trying to liberate yourself from misery, and you are helping others to get liberated from misery. Therefore, I keep on advising my students, that at least one ten-day course, you must find time for at least one ten-day course to give dhamma service. As you find time for one ten-day course to take your own course, similarly, for service, one ten-day course is very important. At times you can't find ten days, all right, then as many days as possible, maybe during the weekend you can come for two days, then have discussion with the management, and if they are agreeable, you can come for two days, three days, one day, and give service. Service is always good for you. May you all develop in dhamma, get established in dhamma, for your good and for the good of so many others. May you all keep on growing in dhamma. May you all keep on glowing in dhamma. Bhavatu Sabhamangalam Salim Falahu Falahu Falahu
