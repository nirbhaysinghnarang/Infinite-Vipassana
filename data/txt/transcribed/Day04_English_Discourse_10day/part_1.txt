The fourth day is over. You have now six more left to work. The fourth day, a very important day. Very important day indeed in the sense that you have started the real practice of Vipassana today. The previous three days we were just making preparation to enter the field of Vipassana, the field of Panna. All the remaining six days are very important because working seriously, diligently, you will get established in this technique which has its own peculiarity. There are many techniques of meditation. This is quite peculiar. One can start meditating by contemplating something, a part of the scriptures, words of some sages or saints, you keep on contemplating, contemplating. Your mind gets concentrated, good, it helps you or you start verbalizing some name, some word, again and again mentally your mind gets concentrated, it helps you or you start visualizing an imaginary shape or form of this god or that goddess, this saintly person or that saintly person and repeatedly you imagine, you imagine, your mind gets concentrated, good, it helps. When you get your mind concentrated, you will find that a change has started at the surface level of the mind, provided the motivation of concentration is not unwholesome, but the change is just at the surface level of the mind. In very deep absorption Samadhis, it may penetrate a little, but it can't reach the depth of the mind. What you call in the western psychology, the conscious mind, the surface of the mind works when you meditate with verbalization, visualization, imagination, it does not touch the depth of the mind and all our problems lie in the depth of the mind at the root level. Our defilements have their roots deep inside, this is the storehouse and it is so fertile. You may cut a particular defilement from the top level, you may cut even the trunk, but the root remains and so long as the root remains, it can sprout again, it will sprout again and will again grow, you are not liberated from this. This was the enlightenment of Gautama. He became enlightened, he became Buddha because he realized that unless you take the roots out, roots of your impurities, if they are not taken out totally, you are not liberated and he found out a way. He worked on this, got liberated and then with all the compassion, love, goodwill started distributing it, we are fortunate, we have the same technique with us and you have taken today, most of you, the first step on the path of Vipassana. Most of you, for the first time, you have taken a dip in the Ganges of Dhamma within, in the Ganges of reality, otherwise from the time one has taken birth, open eyes, started seeing things outside, outside, outside, all the time the outside objects have become so predominant for you, you never care to know what is happening inside, even if you try to meditate with closed eyes, you work with the objects outside which you have read, which you have heard, which you have seen and you contemplate all that. You never try to observe the reality as it is and the reality as it is within the framework of the body is constantly changing, there is no stationary object on which you can keep your attention fixed and this is very helpful to know that everything is changing and you are aware of it within the framework of the body. This is what he called in the language of those days, Nityam Kaya Gata Sati, Sati is awareness, your awareness should be Nityam, all the time Kaya Gata within the framework of the body and you started learning how to keep your attention within the framework of the body with the reality that manifests from moment to moment, from moment to moment. Later on as you develop the technique, you become more and more established in the technique, then in your daily life also whatever you do, you don't lose the contact of the reality inside and you find your mind remains very balanced, in every situation remains very balanced. But at this stage, you have to learn how to be aware of the reality within the framework of the body at the experiential level. In the language of Buddha, language of those days of India, the word Vedana was used and Vedana means experience, a feeling, a sensation, you are not just contemplating, you are not just imagining, you are not just intellectualizing, you are just feeling, actual feeling, you are really experiencing it and that was Vedana and this is what you started doing, feeling the reality from head to feet, from head to feet. This base should not be lost, you have to maintain the awareness of the feeling within the framework of the body. Now questions arise about the technique, you have taken the first step, some questions might arise in your mind also, there are common questions which come in the mind of the students, let us deal with them now. One question that keeps coming is, why move from head to feet, why move? Even immobile I can feel things happening here, here, here, then why move? It is said to be a choiceless observation, effortless observation, let things happen and I will observe, why make even this effort to move? Good question, but understand why you move, not to satisfy a particular tradition, it has its own purpose. If you don't move, then you feel a very strong intense sensation somewhere, your attention goes there, suddenly something else starts somewhere else, your attention goes there, you will be moving from part to part where you get gross, intensified, solidified sensations, most parts will be left out, you will never feel, you will never observe and the subtler sensations that are prevailing on those parts, you will miss them, your mind will remain very gross, the ability of your mind will be to feel only gross sensations, you are not training your mind to feel the subtler ones which are there on other parts of the body because you always work with the intense sensation, this intense sensation or that intense sensation, moving is very important. One reason is that when you proceed on the path, there are important stations and one has to pass through those stations, one of the stations, an important station is that you must reach the stage where you feel sensations everywhere on the body, every part of the body there is a sensation, every particle of the body has a sensation every moment, as long as there is life, wherever there is a life, there is a sensation, you have to develop the sensitivity of your mind, the sharpness of your mind, if that is missing, you won't be able to feel sensations everywhere, you will miss this important station, for that purpose you have to move. Then the question comes if you have to move, alright you move, then why in an order and why in this particular order, this particular order is not necessary, if this order does not suit you and some other order suits you, go ahead, any order but maintain that order because unless you move in order, again and again the same order, you don't know, you might be missing certain parts and as I said we don't want you to miss any part of the body, move in order, very important. Another question, a practical question comes, while you are moving in order, you have reached a certain part and suddenly an intense sensation starts on an area which you have left already or a sensation starts on an area where you have not yet reached, shall I make a jump and go there? Oh no, never do that, then again you will be running from one intense sensation to another intense sensation, from one part of the body to another part of the body, not in order and you will be missing many parts of the body and you will be missing the subtler sensations, you cannot train your mind to feel very subtle sensations which is a very important part of the technique. I have seen people working at random, gross sensations, gross sensations, for years together, they don't reach the stage where they can feel all kinds of sensations, especially the subtler sensations, the subtler reality is that the entire physical structure is made up of tiny little atomic particles and every atomic particle is nothing but wavelet, wavelet, so the entire physical structure is nothing but wavelet, wavelet, vibration, vibration, a modern scientist also says so, modern science says so, there is no solidity in the material world, all wavelets, wavelets, wavelets, the same thing a Buddha said, there is combustion and vibration, entire universe, combustion, vibration, he is experiencing and he puts in word his own experience, the scientist understands it at the intellectual level, we are not against the modern science or modern scientists, they have done, they have played their own part to serve the humanity but if you want to understand the law of nature at the deeper level, you must have direct experience of the nature of the law, the law of the nature and that can be done only when you feel the totality of whatever is happening within the framework of the body, just working with the gross intense sensations, you can't understand the law of nature at the deeper level, therefore it is essential that you go in order, you reached a certain place and some sensation, very intense has started in the area which you have left already, a part of your mind will be knowing it but still keep moving and when you reach there and if it is still there, observe it, if it is gone, it is gone, keep on moving in order, in order. Another question that keeps coming, how long one should take, how long one should take to move from head to feet, there is no fixed time for that, it is a middle path, neither you should at this stage, neither you should speed up so much that in one breath you are from head to feet and you miss so many things, nor you should go so slow that pinpoint, pinpoint, pinpoint takes hours together and your mind will get bored and you can't work, so say about 10 minutes to make one round is good enough, little long also doesn't matter. How much area at a time, initially as you start working 2, 3 inches, 2, 3 inches, 2, 3 inches, good enough but sometimes somebody's mind is very dull or even somebody's mind is very sharp and at times it becomes very dull and you can't feel anything, mind is so gross, sensations are so subtle, you can't feel, then take big chunks, the whole head, the whole face, the whole chest, the whole abdomen, move, big areas, you get one sensation somewhere good, move and keep moving, keep moving, keep moving and you will find slowly you get sensations everywhere, you will reach a stage where you get sensation all around, the tiniest spot you will get sensation, you have to work very patiently, very patiently. Another question that keeps coming, shall we feel the sensations just on the surface of the body or also inside, at this stage when you started working on this technique, better first work on the surface, within these 10 days most of you might reach the stage where you will be able to penetrate and go deeper inside, piercingly, penetratingly and you will feel sensations everywhere, outside, inside, outside, inside but not now, first let your mind be strong enough, sharp enough to feel the reality at the surface level. Of course in some cases it just happens naturally, a student comes and reports that I have started feeling something inside, nothing wrong, if naturally something happens, it happens but intentionally you have to work on the surface of the body at this stage. One point should be very clear as to what the sensation is, the word sensation if it is not clear in your mind, you may be just looking for something and will remain confused, it is so simple, understand it, I keep on repeating, sensation is whatever you experience at the physical level, at the bodily level whatever you feel, it is a sensation, you feel heat, heat is a sensation, you feel perspiration, perspiration is a sensation, you feel throbbing, you feel pulsation, vibration, tingling, sensation, heaviness, numbness, anything that you feel at the physical level is a sensation, difficulty comes sometimes, but in spite of such repeated explanations one does not want to understand what it is and one keeps on looking for something. Many times we come across cases where someone says, no, I don't get any sensation, like tomorrow your assistant teachers will examine you and they will question you, any sensation and one amongst you might say, no, no sensation, no sensation and the second question he or she will ask, could you sit for one hour without changing your posture, oh no, I have to change so many times, why? There was so severe pain, severe pain and yet no sensation, there cannot be a more intense sensation than pain and you say no sensation, because you are looking for something, you are looking for something special, a sensation of bliss, ecstasy, ah wonderful, I came for meditation to experience bliss, what this pain, am I here to observe the pain, I didn't come for pain, pain I already had in my life, why I come here for pain, you are looking for something, very difficult, it happens even during anapana, on the second day or third day when you are asked, any sensation in this area? And someone replies, no, no sensation, what is this? This was just some itching here, itching is no sensation for this person, looking for something, no sensation and someone comes, once a while someone will come and say, oh Goenkaji, I have lot of pain, pressure, heaviness, heat, perspiration, throbbing, everything what you say, but no sensation, no sensation, all these are no sensation for him, he is looking for something special, I always remember the case of my friend, for the first time when I went to a course like this decades ago, initially it was difficult, second day I packed myself to run away from the course, this is not for me. I come from a business community, so much of crooked and cunning mind and this is for simple people who are teachers or professors and things like this, who are good people, I can't do this and then the tradition from which I came, different background, what these people, what they are doing, they are, where is the God, no place for the God, poor God, he is gone, the soul, no soul, what they are talking, what kind of meditation is this and all those thoughts were there, expecting something special, second day I wanted to run, I feel very grateful to a co-meditator, she was so kind, she said, just one day, you get wonderful sensation here, first day I got sensation here, just observe, this is what the teacher wants you to do, carry on, I am grateful, I stayed, otherwise I would have missed such a wonderful thing in my life and when the course was over, anyone who has really gained
