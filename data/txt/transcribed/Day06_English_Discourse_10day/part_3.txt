house she got where somebody is not dying and by that time the whole day she came to senses. There is no house, there is no family where somebody does not die. This is law of nature. People take birth to die sooner or later and now her mind was in a position to learn Dhamma. She came back and Buddha gave Dhamma, the same Dhamma. Observe respiration, observe sensation, go deeper, deeper, deeper and you find all your misery will get evaporated layers after layers and this Kishagottami became an Arhant, fully liberated and all her life serving people like me, so many mothers, like me, so many sisters, oh they are so miserable. If they get this wonderful Dhamma, they will come out of their misery, out of this compassion, kept on serving people in Dhamma, kept on serving people in Dhamma. Another miserable person like this, daughter of a very rich person, Patachara, she also lost her husband, she had two sons, lost both the sons, lost her brother, mother, father. Now nobody was there in the wide world and she became insane, total insane. Running in the streets of Savatthi, totally naked and people throwing stones at her and she won't understand what is happening. Because of some past paramis, some good karmas of the past, she came in contact with Buddha. Buddha was teaching Dhamma to others and she passed by and Buddha said, come my child and she came there and as she sat down, she got senses even for a few minutes and she found that she is naked. Somebody threw a cloth over her and from then onwards she was called Patachara, her name was Patachara. Buddha gave Dhamma, the same technique and working on it, working on it, she came out of all her miseries. If Buddha had used some miraculous powers to give life to the son of Kisagottami or give life to the sons of this Patachara or the husband of Patachara or the mother, father, brother of Patachara, then Buddha would not have been Buddha. Give Dhamma. This is a temporary relief. Even if somebody gets life again, it's a temporary relief. Misery is there all the time. One starts understanding as one progresses on the path, a time comes, one can remember the past, lives after lives and Buddha says, you just see, lives after lives, countless lives. How many of your relatives, your dear ones have passed, passed away, they have died. If you just accumulate the bones of all those who have died in the past and you accumulate, it will be like a huge mountain and the tears that you have shed with every dear one who has died, if you accumulate all those tears, it will be like a huge ocean. You want to carry on the same thing in future also, life after life, countless life in future, again rolling in misery. Come out of it, here is a way, here is a technique, enough is, enough you have suffered so much, come out of it now, come out of it and he gives this technique, which is just law of nature, everybody works on it, whoever works comes out of it and it is not necessary also that to work on this technique, one must come out of the householder's life, one should become a monk or a nun, well if one becomes a monk or a nun, there are less responsibilities of the worldly's life and one can work, give full time to this, the work becomes easier but this is not absolutely essential, dhamma is for everyone, a recluse, a monk, a nun or a householder, householder may have difficulties because of so many responsibilities but still the path is the same for both. Hardly there were hundred thousand monks or nuns with him and rest of them, millions of them in northern India, practicing Vipassana and coming out of their misery, practicing Vipassana, coming out of their misery, an incident of a very rich person, a multi-millionaire of those days, Anathapindika, used to give lot of dana, lot of dana, because tradition is such that a householder must give dana, if one does not give dana, then there is more of ego, as a householder one is not supposed to beg food from others, for a monk it is alright, for a nun it is alright, as a householder one has to earn money, properly, honestly, hardworkingly but when you start earning money, then the madness comes, I am so smart, I am so intelligent and that is why I am earning so much money, this ego, one starts living an ego-centered life, a self-centered life and starts hitting everybody else, oh these people, ignorant people, they are not intelligent, they are not smart, that's why they are not hardworking, that's why they are not earning and I look, I am so smart, I am so intelligent, I am so hardworking, this ego comes, which is dangerous, the whole purpose of giving dana was to come out of the ego and the same dana makes one ego-centered person, one has lost dhamma, one doesn't know, what for I am giving dana, this person was giving a lot of dana, this title, anatha pendaka, anatha means orphans, those who are very poor, pendaka, one who gives them food, that was his title, because he was giving so much food to all hungry people, he had branches of his business throughout India and beyond India, in different countries and this was a rule, that wherever his office or branch is there, nobody should remain, go hungry there, people should get food, but still he didn't know dhamma, came in contact with Buddha, that means came in contact with dhamma, got vipassana, practicing, practicing, purified the mind, purified the mind, got the first dip of nirvanic stage, changed person altogether, now he was a changed person altogether, now giving donation is not to build ego, is to deflate ego, is to dissolve ego, all this money that has come to me, it is because of my past good karmas, it has come to me, it must be used for the good of others, of course as a householder, I must make use of it for my own maintenance, for the maintenance of all those who are depending on me, but the rest of it must go for the good of others, for the good of others, and now he understands the good of others, which is the real good of others, I give food to a hungry person, I must give, it's alright, but next day again this person is hungry, I give water to a thirsty person, after some time again he become thirsty, I give some medicine to a sick person, he may get another disease or the same disease may come up again, I may give clothes to a naked person, after some time the clothes get worn, torn and again he is naked, I am not taking out, I am not helping people to come out of all their miseries, if they get Dhamma, if they get this wonderful technique of Vipassana, oh they come out of their misery, total liberation from misery, misery that they were encountering from life after life, life after life, they will come out of it, Dhamma should go to each and every suffering person, besides all the time giving material dana, this dana is most important, Sabba Dhanam, Dhamma Dhanam Janati, the dana of Dhamma is the highest dana, and he goes to Buddha, Buddha at that time was living in Rajgiri, pays respect to him and tells her, why not come to Shavasthi, he was living in Shavasthi, which was the most populated city of India of those days, most populated city, large number of people are miserable, all miserable, rich or poor, if you have a meditation center there, so many people will get benefit, sir, please do something, come there, Buddha smiled, so he understood that Buddha has agreed, he came back home, looking for a center, a place where Buddha can start teaching Dhamma to people, meditation center should not be in the midst of the city with so much of noise and all, it should not be very far away where people cannot go, so looking for a proper place, peaceful and yet not very far away from the city, he came across, came across a garden, a park, very calm, very quiet, congenial for meditation, and he enquired who is the owner of this park, and he came to know that the prince, the son of the king, is the owner, prince Jeta, and he went to him, sir, I want to buy your park, and the prince became very angry, I am not here to sell my park, this is for my own amusement, I can't sell it, no sir, I have to buy, any price, just to get rid of him, the prince says, you know the price of this land, you have to spread gold sovereigns, the entire land, this is the price, the deal is done, I will spread sovereigns, cart loads of sovereigns he is bringing, and spreading, the prince says, have you gone mad, no land can be that valuable, what you are doing, are you a mad person, he says, no, I am not mad, this land is going to become so valuable, Buddha is going to come here and teach wonderful Vipassana, and all my wealth is nothing compared to one person getting Vipassana, even one person comes out of the misery, my wealth is nothing compared to that, and I know not one person, thousands upon thousands will get benefit, and he made a meditation center, where 10,000 people can live, stay, meditate, learn Dhamma, this volition, to serve others, dana was there, even previously, now the dana is, how more and more people will get benefited, not to inflate his ego, to deflate his ego, dissolve the ego, just to serve others, serve others, this multimillionaire, it so happened, that due to some karmas of the past, he became a pauper, for a short period, he had no money, he is a pauper, and when he was a money person, he will come to this center every day, morning and evening, to meditate, and as a householder, he understands, I should not go to the center empty-handed, I must carry something for the meditators, and every time he comes, he brings something for the meditators, now he's a pauper, he's got nothing to bring, and then something comes in his mind, behind his house, he's got a small garden, and in that garden, he has accumulated very good fertile soil from different parts of India, now he takes two handful of that earth, fertile earth, comes to the center, under a tree, at the root of the tree, may this tree grow, under the shade of this tree, may someone get dhamma, may someone get meditation, volition is there, whether handful of earth, or millions of rupees, makes no difference, volition, it is the volition that counts, after some time again, he became multimillionaire, started giving the knowledge in the same way, he understands dhamma now, that whatever I give, the amount is a material, my volition, my dhamma volition, for the good of others, for the benefit of others, not expecting anything in return, when one does not know dhamma, then one keeps on giving dana, but inflating the ego, one builds a big hospital, a school, a college, but wants it to be named a Goenka hospital, a Goenka school, a Goenka college, and this name must be written in golden letters at the gate, Goenka school, Goenka college, madness, one doesn't know what one is doing, the whole volition is wrong, understanding of dhamma is wrong, the volition is to give without expecting anything in return, to give for the benefit of others, for the benefit of others, how people started changing, changing in their life, different people, householders, one mother Visakha, again a daughter of a very rich person, married to another rich person, but the family had no dhamma at all, and how very wisely she turns the entire atmosphere of this family, where there was no dhamma, how everybody became a good meditator and changed the whole attitude of the family, and the whole family became full of peace, harmony, where there was so much of tension and misery, how dhamma starts working, brings peace for one and all, and this was not merely at the time of Buddha, it kept on, whoever worked, whenever one worked, the same result comes, one incident, in the life of my teacher, when Burma became independent, there were small, small states, princely states, and a person, a good politician, statesman, he amalgamated all these states and made a union of Burma, and to satisfy these princes, one of their leader was made the president of the country, of the Union of Burma, now president has got no power according to the Constitution, there the Prime Minister has all the powers, and yet this person becomes so happy that, I am now the president of the Union of Burma, previously I was just a ruler of a small, small place, very happy, one evening he gives a big party, all the diplomats and the elite of the city, they all come there, a big party, 7.30 is the time to start the party, everybody has come, all the guests have come, the host is not to be seen, 7.45, the host is not to be seen, 8 o'clock, the host is not coming, Prime Minister got worried, what's going on, he sent somebody to the residence, on the first floor, and those who went up there, came back, and told him, sir, he can't come, why, what happened, he has drank so much, he's unconscious, lying on the floor, he can't come, but without the host, how can this party, this is president's party, conscious or unconscious, bring him somehow, let us start the party, and two of them helped him to come, half conscious, half unconscious, hiccuping, hiccuping, and he comes, he's made to sit on the main chair, and the course, and the dinner starts, first course is served, second course is served, when the third course was being served, he started vomiting, vomiting, Prime Minister was so unhappy, we call our land a dhamma land, our government a dhamma government, and what sort of president we have got, what could be done, next day when he came to census, he telephoned to Prime Minister, if you want, I will resign, but I cannot come out of alcohol, it is impossible, in our royal tradition, when the heir to the throne is born, that means the first son to the king is born, then the first input given is the best quality alcohol, in a silver spoon or a gold spoon, this was my first input sir, and since then I am taking alcohol, alcohol, half of my blood has become alcohol, I can't come out, can't come out of alcohol, now this person, fortunate because of some good parmi of the past, one day he passes in front of the teacher's C.I.G. Hubakin Centre, just out of inquisitiveness enters there, and that was the day, the tenth day, the last day, and he sees everybody's face blooming, with operation is over now, and balm is given on the wounds, everybody smiling, smiling, hey what's going on here, meditation is taught, what meditation, hanapana is taught, vipassana is taught, being a born Buddhist, he has been reading about this hanapana and vipassana in the scriptures, but he never knew that anybody is teaching this, and such results are coming, everybody says we feel so peaceful, so harmonious, I had no peace in my life, I never know what harmony is, I'm such an agitated person, sir can I come, can I come also join, yes yes, whether a prince or a pauper, anybody, everybody can come and meditate, what shall I have to do, hero take five precepts, five precepts, oh no, no, no, four precepts, fifth one is out of question, I can't do, then go away, we can't take you, and he wants this peace, and he's not taken, so he starts arguing, starts bargaining, one little peg sir, every day, very little, no, nothing doing, one peg after alternative days, nothing doing, one in five days, nothing doing, go away, we can't teach you unless you have got this foundation strong, these five silas are foundation of meditation, and then he says all right, then somehow I will control myself, but sir, under one condition, that when I go back home, you should not stop me from drinking, how can I stop you going back home, you are your own master, you drink as much as you like, but here, no, I would recommend you going back home, you should not drink, but if you drink, how can I stop you, but these ten days, no drink, all right sir, I want peace, I want harmony, and he practiced, the same practice, after ten days, he goes to the president's house, his own house there, and somebody is drinking even hundred yards away, he says stinking, who is drinking here, he can't bear, he can't bear others drinking, out of question for him to drink, and the whole ten days, nobody told him, if you go back home and drink, you will get this hell or that hell, nothing doing, in Dhamma, there is no threatening, what happens, what is drink, he's addict to the sensation of the drink, and when he learned how to observe the sensation, observe the sensation, all the sankharas of the alcohol had gone away, the addiction of alcohol was gone away, how can you drink now, if this has happened only to one president of the Union of Burma, perhaps there was some miracle involved, this happens to thousands of people coming to courses, addict to alcohol, addict to drug, addict to this or more than that, addict to craving, addict to aversion, addict to fear, addict to depression, all these mental illnesses, how they go away easily, Dhamma is so wonderful, Dhamma is so scientific, Dhamma is so non-sectarian, Dhamma is so universal, Dhamma is so result-oriented, it gives you result here and now, in this very life, good that you joined the course, make best use of the remaining four days, they are wonderful days of your life, at least get established in the technique, how to practice it, it's a lifetime job, you have to work for the whole life, but get established in the technique, make use of the time, make use of the opportunity, make use of the facility, make use of this wonderful Dhamma, the wonderful technique, to come out of the bondage of all the cravings, aversions, illusions, delusions, to enjoy real peace, real harmony, real happiness, may all of you enjoy real peace, real harmony, real happiness. MANGALAM BHAVATHU SAVVAMANGALAM SAVVAMANGALAM Take rest for about five minutes and then again start working, take rest for five minutes.
